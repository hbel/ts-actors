# 1.0.x

Version 1.0.3 Several small bugfixes, but no change in functionality

Version 1.0.0 is a major overall which includes updates to most dependencies, rewrite of inner functions and a first version of a distributed actor system. In addition, all dependencies that were not
absolutely neccessary (including tsmonads and winston) have been removed. `ts-actors` now only depends on `ramda`, `uuid`, and `rxjs`.
